To run the program successfully starting with part 1, first, open 4 separate terminal windows
and cd into the part1 directory in each of the instances.

Next, in one of the windows, enter the command: "python3 C_server.py" which will start the server.

Next, in a separate window, enter the command: "python3 R_router.py"

Next, in a separate window, enter the command: "python3 B_node.py"

Finally, in the 4th and last window, enter the command: "python3 A_node.py"

These have to be executed in this order for the full program to work. After you enter the last command
in the fourth window, the program will automatically execute accross each of the nodes and terminate 
itself, allowing you to view the results on each node.

To execute part 2 of the assignment, cd into the part2 directory in each of the 4 terminal instances 
and repeat the exact steps above in the same order.
